# Feed Reader Testing

## Overview
I built this project as a part of the front-end nanodegree program by Udacity. It involves writing test suites for JavaScript code using the Jasmine framework, which helps building applications using the test-driven approach.

## Purpose
Learning to apply test-driven programming and the Red-Green-Refactor Cycle to speed up the process of building error-free web applications.

## Running the Script
- Clone the repo and run the `index.html` file. 
- Feel free to experiment and play with the test suites and specifications.

## Contribution
If you see any chance to improve the code, please do make a Pull Request.
